Welcome, and thank you for trying out my project

My project is A Casino Simulation to a popular online sandbox Game Growtopia

-So if you still don't know in Growtopia there is a community made casino which is not intended/made by 
developers and it is marked illegal which is resulting to get your account at risk and lose your in game currency
while playing casino

-So if you just wanna try a similar casino to game Growtopia just for entertainment,
try out this simulation and enjoy

(Compatibility)

- This project is mostly compatible to most computer and android devices, unfortunately it might not be compatible
to most ios devices.

(How To Use)

- If you already download the file you can open the folder and double click the html file named "index"

-there is a built in edit currency feature if you want to add money to your account, which is written 
"Edit your balance" in button, so just click it to enter currency editing mode

-Some 3 currency available are Blue Gem Lock, Diamond Lock, And World Lock, double click the the currency image
near the currency value to exchange currency.

-You cannot exchange currency while the "Wheel" is spinning, this is necessary to prevent game breaking glitches

-The bet you should enter when spinning should only be multiples of "10" for example: 10,20,30,40,50...

(Convertion rate)

-100 World locks is equal to 1 Diamond lock
-100 Diamond locks is equal to 1 Blue Gem Lock

-Don't worry to convert currency, you can convert it back anytime

-This project is made with effort and passion, I hope you enjoy my project

-This open source project is created for parody purpose of the game and not meant to have save.dat stealer on users
